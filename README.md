# in the ey of the storm

## stackblitz credentials are not shown

a naked server does not talk to us where it is sitting on

-> [`read the docs`](https://github.com/pflegende/http-server-egur84/wiki/caput-1----read-the-docs#how-does-it-work)

## a step by step tut - where?

### server2.js doesnt see index.html

- what was wrong?
- is it enough for a issue?

so somebody is reading this 
--- give us a hint 

;)
